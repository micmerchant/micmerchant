### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael, software architect from the beautiful Klagenfurt in the south of Austria :austria: at [SKIDATA](https://www.skidata.com/home). I like to improve/refactor code, mentor others, share my knowledge and try to bring the team forward in terms of code quality.

I prefer to work with <img alt="DotNet" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dotnet-1572B6?logo=dotnet&logoColor=white&style=flat"/> and <img alt="C Sharp" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-1572B6?logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white&style=flat"/>. There are so many things to learn in the <img alt="DotNet" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dotnet-1572B6?logo=dotnet&logoColor=white&style=flat"/> world, great NuGet packages to try out, architectural patterns, best practices and much more. I'm sure you all know this: It's easy to learn, but hard to master. 

Due to a demand at the former job, I'm currently working on a [plugin](https://github.com/micmerchant/nhibernate-mssql-table-valued-functions) for the [NHibernate](https://nhibernate.info/) ORM to support [MSSQL Table-Valued-Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/user-defined-functions/user-defined-functions?view=sql-server-ver16#table-valued-functions) in LINQ Queries.
